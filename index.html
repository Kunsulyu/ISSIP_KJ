                Cloud computing has emerged as a transformative service innovation, exemplified by platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS). By providing on-demand access to scalable computing resources, storage, and software over the internet, cloud computing offers numerous benefits. It enables businesses to reduce infrastructure costs, increase agility, and scale rapidly to meet changing demands. However, cloud computing also presents potential harms, such as data privacy and security risks, vendor lock-in, and dependence on internet connectivity. As organizations increasingly rely on cloud services, it is crucial to carefully manage these risks while harnessing the power of cloud computing to drive innovation and efficiency.
